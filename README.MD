# ðŸ§ª My Data Science Playground

Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks â€“ a digital lab notebook chronicling my adventures (and occasional misadventures) in data science. From late-night experiments with neural architectures to weekend deep-dives into dataset peculiarities, these notebooks capture my learning journey and technical discoveries.

## ðŸ¤” What's This All About?

Think of this as my digital garden of data science exploration. You'll find:
- Experimental notebooks where I test wild hypotheses
- Implementation attempts of papers that caught my eye
- Deep dives into datasets that made me go "hmmm..."
- Learning exercises where I break (and sometimes fix) things

Fair warning: Some notebooks are polished and production-ready, others are beautiful disasters that taught me valuable lessons. All of them reflect real learning moments.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack I Use

### Core Tools
- Python (my trusty swiss army knife)
- Jupyter (where the magic/chaos happens)
- Google Colab (for when my GPU starts crying)

### DS/ML Libraries
- PyTorch & TensorFlow (because sometimes you need both)
- scikit-learn (old reliable)
- pandas & numpy (the workhorses)
- matplotlib & plotly (for making things pretty)

- ...

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

2. Create a virtual environment (trust me, you'll want isolation):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install --notebooks requirements--
```

3. Start exploring! Each notebook should be relatively self-contained with its own documentation and requirements.

## ðŸ’­ Personal Notes

- These notebooks are both a learning tool and a reference for Future Me
- Some experiments worked beautifully, others... let's call them "learning opportunities"
- Feel free to use any code or insights, but remember: some of these are experiments, not production code
- I try to keep dependencies updated, but no promises on older notebooks

Remember: This is a personal learning repository. Expect some rough edges, honest documentation, and real-world experimentation rather than perfectly polished code.
